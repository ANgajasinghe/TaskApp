“Unit testing” is writing many small tests that each test one very simple function or object behavior. 
TDD is a thinking process that results in unit tests, and “thinking in tests” tends to result in more fine-grained and comprehensive testing, 
and an easier-to-extend software design.Please keep the questions coming! It’s a great way to keep this newsletter timely and helpful.

## Test Drival Development

TDD is not a technology, it is an approach. That will guide you to write more cleaner and understandable codes.

In TDD,  
1. First of all, we need to understand what are the user requirements clearly. 
2. Then we write a test to fail. It's indicated as RED status.
3. One test case is failed. We write codes to pass that test case it's indicated as GREEN.
4. Then we can refactor that written code. You can follow SOLID principles in this step.
5. And again run that test case and verify that refactored code against the test case.

### Advantages of TDD
1. The intention of your code is clear, It means you have understood the requirements as well.
2. Iterative development and testing.
3. Catching defects early.
4. You are forces to write test cases.
5. Documentation.
6. Defects can catch very easily even it occurred in the production.
